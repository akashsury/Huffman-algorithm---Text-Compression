# Huffman-algorithm---Text-Compression

Compression-> Using Huffman Encoding algorithm, the python code is created to compress the text files. Once, the files are compressed then we will get two files - Symbol Table and Compressed file. The Symbol Table contains each character present in the text files and the corresponding code of each character.  
Decompression-> To get original file back, we are going to decompress the files using the symbol table and compressed file.
 
Note: This will work only for text files.
